# üë®‚Äçüíª About Me


Hello! I‚Äôm a BTech undergrad at IIT Jammu, exploring the world of programming. I‚Äôve been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with some experience in Python and C++, and recently worked on my first project, Manomitra, IIT Jammu‚Äôs mental wellbeing website.

üî≠ **Currently working on:** Building a solid foundation in backend development and Data Structures & Algorithms.

ü§ù **Open to collaborating on:** Beginner-friendly projects that focus on practical skills and problem-solving.

‚úã **Looking to learn more about:** Backend development practices to deepen my understanding and become a more well-rounded developer.

üå± **Always learning:** New skills in programming and software development as I grow in this field.

üí¨ **Ask me about:** My journey so far, or my experience building *Manomitra*.

‚ö° **Fun fact:** I like tackling projects from scratch to understand the fundamentals‚Äîeven if it means figuring things out the hard way!

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or have any advice on backend development and full-stack projects!
